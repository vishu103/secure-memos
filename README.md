#### 1000 App Pledge

The 1000 App Pledge is a challenge I have set out for me to create 1000 apps. I'm doing this to help build my portfolio and improve my development skills. The apps I will develop will range from very simple to very complex and useful.

This the 2nd app I developed under this pledge.

# Secure Memos
This is an extremely secure memo app. This app uses AES-256 encryption to secure your memos and only the person with the secret key holds the power to decrypt a memo. The secret key and the original unencrypted text is not stored, so if you forget the secret key, you forget ever decrypting the memo.

**Minimum SDK Version:** 19

**Clone and import in Android Studio to mess around.**
